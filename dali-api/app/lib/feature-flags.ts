// contract (app/jobs/registry.ts): registry seeds, row wins, rows self-heal.
//
// Server-side evaluation (resolveFeatureFlags / isFeatureEnabled) lives in
// feature-flags.server.ts. The React context + useFeatureFlag hook that read
// the resolved map on the client live in app/components/FeatureFlags.tsx.
